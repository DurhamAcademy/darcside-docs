All communication between team members must be through our own tools like Microsft Teams. About Discord is one of the best places to get near-realtime support for pretty much any topic in FRC. The following servers are almost always active and you'll usually get a response in under 5 minutes. These servers also have active social and off-topic channels where you can get to know members of other teams and discuss things like sports or computers. Remember that people on Discord likely do not know anything about our team or robot, so you may need to provide additional context if asking for help. If you're not familiar with Discord, it functions similarly to tools like Microsoft Teams or Slack. Topics are separated into text channels to which one can send messages to. You can also join certain roles, which give you access to additional channels and/or mark you as a member of a specific groups, such as subteams. Discord also supports voice channels, which can also be used for video chat and screen-sharing. Servers FIRST Robotics Competition This is the official Discord server for FRC, where teams around the world can discuss pretty much any topic relevant to FRC. Many WPILib developers and employees of vendors like REV and CTRE are active here. Join FRC North Carolina This an unofficial Discord server that provides a place for all FRC students and alumni in North Carolina a place to chat. Most discussion surrounding FIRST events in North Carolina occurs here as well. Join Other Servers There are a variety of other servers focused on more specialized topics within FRC. For example, software libraries such as PhotonVision will usually have their own Discord servers for support and development discussion. There are also plenty of servers focused on socializing instead of technical disucssion.","title":"Discord"},{"location":"getting-help/discord/#discord","text":"Important Remember that you represent our team when chatting in open forums.
