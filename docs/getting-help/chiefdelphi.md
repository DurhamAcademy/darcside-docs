## About
Chief Delphi is an online forum that has been around since nearly the dawn of FRC. It is designed around a more traditional forum layout, so longer discussions are common. While Discord may be better for basic troubleshooting, if you want to dive into the pros and cons of something or discuss a more complex topic, Chief Delphi is an excellent place to do so. It's also an excellent place to get feedback on designs.
